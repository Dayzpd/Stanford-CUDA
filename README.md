# Stanford-CUDA
MP 1-3 of Stanford's free online CUDA course.

As part of a CUDA Programming self study course I am doing alongside my professor, Dr. Gowing, I selected the first three machine problems
from Stanford's CUDA course in order to familiarize myself with the basics of CUDA. Having finished these as of February 2019, I am
currently working on implementing a back propagating neural net and convolutional neural net using CUDA during the Spring 2019 semester.
